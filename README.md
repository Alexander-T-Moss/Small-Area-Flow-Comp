# Small Area Flow Compenstation - SAFC
A general solution to combat extrusion related issues on small areas of solid infill, now available natively in the latest versions of [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases) and [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases) plus a standalone script for [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases), [BambuStudio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases) and older versions of OrcaSlicer and SuperSlicer!

# Print Showcase
Thanks to all the wonderful people that went above and beyond during the initial beta testing of SAFC. Below is a collage of some great prints people got using SAFC

# Teaching Tech's Video On SAFC
Teaching Tech also created a great way to [tune SAFC](https://www.printables.com/model/904788-small-area-flow-compensation-tester) which I highly recommend you spend time to check out! (Especially useful if printing with nozzles that are not the standard 0.4mm that the defaut model is based on)
