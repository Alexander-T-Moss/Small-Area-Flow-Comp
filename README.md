# Teaching Tech's Video On SAFC
Teaching Tech also created a great way to [tune SAFC](https://www.printables.com/model/904788-small-area-flow-compensation-tester) which I highly recommend you spend time to check out! (Especially useful if printing with nozzles that are not the standard 0.4mm that the defaut model is based on)
