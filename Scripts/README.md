# How Do I Use This Script

The first thing you need is the script for your relavent platform (`win`, `osx_intel`, `osx_arm`, `linux`), so download the one you need from the latest release. When saving it on your computer, the file path to the script **cannot have spaces in it**, so any folders it goes in cannot have spaces, then follow the steps for your relavent slicer below:



### PrusaSlicer/SuperSlicer

---

1. Navigate to `Post-processing scripts` via `Print Settings >> Output options` 
2. Paste the path to your script in the text field (*see screenshot below, file path will differ*)
